###Registration

----------

Once authenticated, registration may or may not be required depending on the provider and what information you want for your application.  Platform requires an email address, so an email will always be required.

There are 4 possible registration scenarios.

#### User is already logged in via Platform

If the user is already logged in to the application, no further registration will be required.  It will automatically tie the social account with the current logged in user.

#### User is not logged in, but has an account

If the user is not logged in, but does have a Platform account already, they can log into their account to tie the social account to theirs.

#### User is not logged in and does not have an account

If the user is not logged in and doesn't have an account, they will need to input their email address to finish authenticating.  A Platform account will then automatically be created for them in the process.

#### User is not logged in but the provider gave us an email

If the user is not logged in but the provider gives us an email, we can auto create an account for them with no further input.  It will be like a registration process did not occur.  If you still wish to have more fields, you can ask for the extra input afterwards.
