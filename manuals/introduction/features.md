###Features

----------

Platform Manuals isn't just an ordinary Markdown to HTML conversion tool. It's feature-rich:

 - Customizable using Platform's powerful theme management.
 - Supports unlimited amount of manuals
 - Simplistic markdown folder structure
 - [git](http://git-scm.com/) integration - files may be edited by users where upon save, a pull request is made on the manuals repo (if hosted on [github](http://www.github.com)).
 - Some other very important point.
