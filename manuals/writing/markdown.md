###Markdown

----------

>"Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax...the overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email." *- Mark Gruber (Inventor of Markdown)*

The reason we use Markdown is because it's easy to read and write. It's also styling agnostic, leaving the developer with power to style the markdown output however they feel appropriate.

People with little or no technical knowledge can write Markdown. There are also a bunch of apps for OS X and Windows to help you write Markdown files:

 - [Mou - The missing Markdown editor for web developers](http://mouapp.com/) [OS X]
 - [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) [Windows]

Of course, nearly any text editor will do the job as well.
