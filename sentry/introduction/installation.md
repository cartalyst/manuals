###Installation

----------

Once downloaded, you will probably want to autoload the bundle by adding the following code to your application bundles.php file.


	'sentry' => array(
		'auto'     => true,
	),

Installing the tables for sentry is as simple as running its migration.

>**Note:** If you wish to change the default table names, you may adjust them in the configuration file.
