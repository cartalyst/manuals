###Session

----------

The properties that Sentry uses in the Session can be changed from their defaults should you wish to do so. A reason for this could be if they are conflicting with another session property you are using.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Option</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Default</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>user</td>
		<td>string</td>
		<td>sentry_user</td>
		<td>Sets the session key to retrieve the Sentry User.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>provider</td>
		<td>int</td>
		<td>sentry_provider</td>
		<td>Sets the session key to retrieve the Sentry Provider.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
