#### Adminstration - User Setup

In Step 3 you will be creating your initial adminsitrative user for Platform. You will simply need to provide a first and last name, a valid email, and matching password.  

Once again, Platform will not let you go past this step until the fields have passed validation once again.  There will be notification on the left under Step 3 updating you on your validation process.

Once validated, you may proceed onto step 4.
