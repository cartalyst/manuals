#### Preparing for Installation

Step 1 is setting up your system for the installation process.  This just includes giving the proper permissions to a select few directories and files so platform can write to them.

Files and Directories to be modified for platform Installation:

`C:\wamp\www\work\platform\platform\application\config\application.php`

`C:\wamp\www\work\platform\platform\application\config\database.php`

`C:\wamp\www\work\platform\public\platform\themes\compiled\`

Once these permissions are set, you can proceed onto Step 2.
