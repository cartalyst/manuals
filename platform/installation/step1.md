#### Preparing for Installation

Step 1 is setting up your system for the installation process.  This just includes giving the proper permissions to a select few directories and files so platform can write to them.

Files and Directories to be modified for platform Installation:

`platform/application/config/`

`platform/application/config/application.php`

`public/platform/themes/compiled/`

Once these permissions are set, you can proceed onto Step 2.
