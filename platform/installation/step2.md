#### Database Setup

Step 2 consists of setting your database driver and credentials for the database installation process. Simply provide Platform with your database driver ( such as mysql ), server, username, password, and database name you wish to use.

Platform will only let you continue past this step if it can connect to the database. Notification of connectivity is provided under the Step 2 text on the left.

Once connected, you may proceed onto step 3.
