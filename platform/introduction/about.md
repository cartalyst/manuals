###Platform

The Platform is an application base, think of it as a bootstrap for Laravel. It includes all the fundamentals and essentials that are normally required of a web based application. It is well documented, and feature rich.

####Who's gonna love it.

We kept the Platform core light and built it upon a strong PHP framework with great documentation and a fantastic community. We hope those currently working with Laravel will enjoy this new resource and we hope a few others will to :)

#####For Project Managers & web app creators.

Designing an application on paper is easy, the meat of it not so much. Stay focused on project features and let your developers and designers get down to the specifics of what makes your application unique.

#####Developers

Having the power of Laravel at your disposal is great, having a base application out of the box with documentation and the essentials even greater.

#####Front End Developers

Gain the power to create and manage themes alongside Laravelâ€™ amazing blade template engine. Not only can you have multiple themes you can create theme options editable with the included theme manager.
