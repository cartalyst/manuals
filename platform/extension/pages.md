###Pages

----------

Pages is where you can make pages for the frontend of your site. This is a basic CMS that allows you to manage entire pages and static content through Platform's admin panel. Pages can consist of pieces of content, thus reducing the amount of duplicated words. Just subsitute in `@content('key_of_content_here')`.
