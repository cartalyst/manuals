###Download

----------

Download Crud into your Laravel installation's [bundles](http://laravel.com/docs/bundles#creating-bundles) directory.

There are 3 ways to download Crud:

1. [Download](https://github.com/cartalyst/crud/zipball/master) a zip archive from our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cartalyst/crud)
2. Run the following [git](http://git-scm.com) command from your Laravel installation's **bundles** directory:  

       $ git clone git@github.com:cartalyst/crud.git

3. Run the following git command from your Laravel installation's **root** directory:

       $ git submodule add git@github.com:cartalyst/crud.git bundles/crud

   >**Notes:** The above command assumes you have your Laravel installation under version control and that you are using the default **bundles** directory. If your bundles directory is not default, you may need to alter the command to reflect your **bundles** directory.
