### Migrations

----------

To run the Logs migrations, you simply just need to log into your Admin section and go to `System > Extensions`.  From there, Logs should be listed once your files are uploaded.  Simply hit the install button and the migrations will run.  Logs is now installed.  Also, make sure once you install Logs, that the extension is also enabled.
