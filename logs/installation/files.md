### Files

----------

Installing Logs files is pretty straight forward.  We set up the directory to allow you to just drag and drop the root folder into your platform install. This way you won't have to worry about anything besides changing your theme name for the views. If you modified your platform installation at all, you will simply just need to modify your file structure or copy in each `logs` folder appropriately.  No file editing needs to be done.

Also note that if you have a custom theme with a different template naming structure, you will need to modify the template layout calls in your views as needed.
