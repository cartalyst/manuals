###Prerequisites

----------

Before commencing this tutorial, you should probably have a look over the [Platform Manuals](/manuals/platform) to get a basic understanding of what Platform is and what it can do for you.

In particular, two sections to focus on would be the [Extension Guide](/manuals/platform/extensions) and the [Theme Guide](/manuals/platform/themes). We will be building on some concepts in those manuals in this tutorial.
