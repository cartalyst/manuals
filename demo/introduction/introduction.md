###What We're Building

----------

We're going to be building a Platform extension that showcases a lot of the functionality available in Platform and how easy it is to extend.

The extension will be called "Books" - it will manage a catalog of books for you. That's right - a tutorial that **is not** how to create a blog!

Our extension will:

- Have an aministration area where books can be added, updated and deleted.
- Have a frontend area where books can be viewed by users of the app.
- Allow for the uploading of book covers (images).
- Use a configuration file to allow the changing of settings if needed.
- Have a widget to display recently added books
